spockfs
=======

SpockFS is an HTTP based network filesystem

It is built upon plain HTTP methods and headers (no XML, no XML and no XML) and supports all of the FUSE posix-related hooks (yes you can manage symlinks too). 

Specs
=====

To avoid "collisions" with WebDAV services, new methods have been added, while the "classic" ones are used where possible.

The following methods have been added:

* READDIR
* GETATTR
* MKNOD
* OPEN
* CHMOD
* CHOWN
* TRUNCATE
* ACCESS
* SYMLINK
* READLINK
* RMDIR
* MKDIR
* LINK
* RENAME
* FALLOCATE
* STATFS
* LISTXATTR
* GETXATTR
* SETXATTR
* REMOVEXATTR
* UTIMENS

While the following "standard" ones are used:

* POST
* PUT
* GET
* DELETE

The reference FUSE client
=========================

The reference server implementation (uWSGI plugin)
==================================================

Why ?
=====

Unbit is already developing an high performance 9p network filesystem server (https://github.com/unbit/9spock), but during development we came up with this really simple (and working) implementation. You can build a server really fast and over battle-tested technologies (nginx, apache, uWSGI ...) and web frameworks.

Finally, after having worked/developed the https://github.com/unbit/davvy project (a WebDAV/CalDAV/CardDAV django implementation) i came up with the conclusion that i will never touch again any WebDAV-related thing. Seriously.
